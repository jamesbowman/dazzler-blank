This repo is a blank template for the Gameduino 3X Dazzler FPGA.

If you want to use the Dazzler as a FPGA platform, you can start with this template, and build up.

All Dazzler signals are present; there's zero logic in the top-level file ``dazzler_blank.v``, only a few assignments to keep the Xilinx tools happy.
